"""Local live-editing server for docsync reports — project-aware.

    make -C report2027 live          # http://localhost:8010/primer/start.html

The loop this exists for: edit a report — by hand in content.md / layout.json,
or by asking Claude to — and see it in the browser in about a second. No
commit, no CI wait. Save in the draft editor writes the files and commits
LOCALLY; Push is a separate, explicit step that sends it to GitHub, so a save
can never surprise-trigger a deploy or a GitHub Actions run.

Local-first: the files on disk are the single source of truth. The editor
served from here reads and writes THEM (not the GitHub API), and a watcher
rebuilds each project's preview whenever its own files change — so your edits
and Claude's land in the same place and show up together. Stdlib only, except
PyYAML for docsync.yml (already required by docsync.registry).

One process, many projects, possibly many repos: this repo's own docsync.yml
(rxkids, demo-report, and this repo's own budget-primer test fixture) is
always available; `docs/primer/projects.json` — the same registry start.html
reads for its grid — can additionally name a project whose real files live in
a DIFFERENT repo on disk (an optional "local_root"), so a live server always
launched from here can still edit, say, the real Budget Primer content that
lives in ~/BudgetPrimerFinal. Everything below is keyed by project id; there
is no more one global ROOT/CONTENT/LAYOUT — see PROJECTS.

    # ---- inventory: the document as data, without a browser -----------------
    # The editor's own docsync.api.inventory() is the richer answer — it
    # MEASURES the live DOM, so it knows where every designed element actually
    # paints. This is the headless twin, for a CI check, a script, or an MCP
    # client with no browser at all: everything the FILES know, exactly, and
    # nothing guessed.
    #
    # What that boundary means in practice, and it is worth stating plainly
    # rather than letting a caller discover it: layout.json holds geometry only
    # for things somebody PLACED (shapes, boxes, tables, anything ever dragged).
    # A designed element sitting where its renderer put it has no stored
    # coordinates — its position exists only once a browser has laid the page
    # out — so `placed` covers the first kind and `elements` lists the ids of
    # both without claiming geometry for the second. Geometry for an unmoved
    # designed element needs the editor API; everything else is here.

    # round trip, each needing the tab open and fronted. This relays a verb to
    # the editor tab that already holds the live stream, so the same call is a
    # curl away: no extension, no JS-string escaping, no tab focus.
    #
    # It is NOT the out-of-band write /__inventory refuses to be. The op runs
    # INSIDE the open editor through window.docsync.api — the document stays
    # in memory, pushHistory() still runs first (⌘Z undoes a relayed op like a
    # human's), and render() validates it like any other edit. Nothing here
    # touches files behind the editor's back.
    #
    # Exactly-once by construction: ops are drained by the SSE writer, and the
    # SSE stream is held by exactly ONE tab (the leader election in edit.html).
    # A dispatched op is never re-queued — if the tab dies mid-op the caller
    # gets a timeout, which is honest, where a retry would risk applying the
