## Adding SVGs / graphics the editor can move & resize

**Any SVG, diagram, icon-lockup, or decorative graphic you add to the report
MUST be emitted through `graphic()` in `report2027/tools/render_report.py`** —
never as a bare `<svg>` in the markup. A bare `<svg>` is frozen: the draft
editor can't see it, so the user can't reposition or resize it. `graphic()`
gives it the same `data-el` hook an image has, so the editor moves, resizes
(proportionally, from any corner), rotates, and layers it, with the placement
remembered in `report2027/layout.json`.

```python
# el_id: unique + stable (survives across rebuilds; it's the layout.json key).
# The SVG MUST carry a viewBox so it scales to the wrapper width. w = default
# width in inches before the user sizes it.
{graphic("spent.flowchart", '<svg viewBox="0 0 200 120" ...>...</svg>', w=2.4)}
```

- Give each graphic a **unique, stable `el_id`** (`<page>.<name>`). Renaming it
  orphans whatever position the user dragged it to.
- The SVG **needs a `viewBox`**; use `fill`/`stroke` colours (it can be
  recoloured from the editor's colour tools since it's inline).
- Small header/inline glyphs that belong INSIDE another element (e.g. a card
  title icon) are not graphics — leave those inline. `graphic()` is for
  free-standing things the user should be able to move on their own.

**New visuals are SEPARATE primitives, grouped — never fused.** A labelled
box = a `shapes` rect + a `boxes` text box in layout.json + a `groups` entry
(`["<shapeId>", "text.<boxId>"]`) so they move together until the user hits
Ungroup (⌘⇧G). Never bake sentences inside an SVG or fuse text + background
into one div — the user must be able to detach the text. Full schema and
rules: the `report-editor` skill.

The mechanism, if you need to extend it: `graphic()` wraps the SVG in
`<span class="ds-graphic" data-el=...>`; `.ds-graphic` CSS in
`report2027/web/primer.css` makes the SVG fill the wrapper; the editor's
`isGraphic()` in `docsync/editor/edit.html` gives `.ds-graphic` corner
handles. `tests/editor/graphic.spec.js` (in the primer-editor repo) guards it.

## Repo layout & the editor

- The live editor / engine (`docsync/`, `report2027/tools/serve.py`,
  `edit.html`) is **vendored from the separate `~/primer-editor` repo, and the
  vendoring is AUTOMATIC**: primer-editor's post-commit hook runs
  `python3 -m docsync.vendor`, which copies the engine here, restages
  `docs/primer`, and makes a local commit. So: NEVER edit engine files in this
  repo — the next vendor run refuses while they're dirty, and your change
  would be orphaned anyway. Fix engine/editor/tooling bugs in
  `~/primer-editor` and commit there; the copy arrives on its own. Report
  *content* (`content.md`, `layout.json`, the numbers, page-specific markup
  like the appropriation-card icons) is owned HERE and never flows back.
- **Never launch the live server yourself.** "Budget Primer Editor.app" owns
  it; a server started any other way can't reach the keychain and its Push
  hangs. If it needs a restart, ask the user to relaunch the app.
- `make -C report2027 pub` is the ONE build command (used by the live server,
  Save, and CI). `report2027/web/index.html` and `docs/primer/` are generated —
  never hand-edit them.
- Save commits locally; Push sends the current branch AND fast-forwards `main`
  (the deploy branch), so **every Push publishes to the live site**.
