"""Stage the draft editor next to a report.

    python3 -m docsync.stage --id budget-primer

The editor runs the report's OWN renderer in the browser, so it needs that
renderer, whatever the renderer reads, and a description of the report. All of
that is copied to `<dir>/engine/` and described by `<dir>/engine/manifest.json`,
and the editor is copied in beside it.

Two things this buys, and they are the point:

* **One editor, any report.** The editor knows nothing about the Budget Primer.
  It reads the manifest sitting next to it and renders whatever it names. A
  second report is a second entry in docsync.yml, not a second editor.
* **Same origin.** Fetching the renderer from raw.githubusercontent let its CDN
  hand out a copy several commits old — a page that renders fine and is quietly
  wrong. Staged here, the engine can only ever be the one that shipped with the
  editor it is running in.

Everything written here is a build artifact, like the rendered HTML. Never edit
it; edit `docsync/editor/edit.html` and re-stage.
