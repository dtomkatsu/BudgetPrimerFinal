"""Vendor the engine into every consumer repo — automatically.

    python3 -m docsync.vendor            # sync all consumers in vendor.yml
    python3 -m docsync.vendor --dry-run  # show what would change
    python3 -m docsync.vendor --force    # overwrite even a dirty consumer
    python3 -m docsync.vendor --no-commit

This repo is the canonical home of the editor engine; consumer repos
(~/BudgetPrimerFinal, and any future report repo) carry vendored COPIES so
each stays self-contained for CI, other machines and madison. The copies
used to be synced by hand — "fix here, remember to copy" — which is exactly
the kind of accounting that rots. Now:

- Every consumer ALSO gets a permission guard in its own .claude/settings.json
  (permissions.ask on docsync/** and the EXTRA paths below) — an AI session
  working on that report defaults to driving the editor's UI for content
  changes (see the consumer's own CLAUDE.md) and has to ask before editing
  engine code directly. This is added and kept up to date the same way the
  code is: automatically, on every vendor run, to every consumer in
  vendor.yml/vendor.local.yml — including ones added after this was written.
  Merged in, never overwritten: existing permissions are left alone.

- WHAT the engine is needs no manifest: every file git tracks under
  docsync/ plus report2027/tools/serve.py. Add a module to the package and
  it vendors itself.
- WHO consumes it is one line per repo in vendor.yml.
- WHEN is automatic: .githooks/post-commit runs this after any commit that
  touches an engine path (install once per clone:
  git config core.hooksPath .githooks).

Per consumer this script: refuses if the consumer's engine paths are dirty
(engine edits must never originate in a consumer — fix here first;
--force overrides), copies the canonical files, restages every editor
binding in the consumer's own docsync.yml, and commits JUST the engine
paths there (a local commit only — deploying is still the consumer's own
explicit Push). It never starts or stops anyone's dev server; if the
consumer's live server is running, it reminds you to relaunch the app.
