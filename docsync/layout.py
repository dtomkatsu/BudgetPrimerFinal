"""Layout overrides: positions and shapes, as data.

The report's design lives in the renderer, and that is what keeps it a designed
artifact rather than a blank canvas — twelve pages that stay twelve pages
because only text varies. This module does not change that. It adds a thin
layer on top: where an override exists the renderer honours it, and everywhere
else the code's own design stands.

So a dragged box is one line of JSON, reviewable in a diff and revertable by
deleting it, instead of a hand-edit to layout code. With no overrides the file
is empty and the published HTML is byte-for-byte what it always was.

Coordinates are inches from the page's top-left corner, because `.page` is
`position: relative` and absolutely positioned children resolve against it.

        A slot says what the report always says; a box is a note someone put on
        one page. That is why it lives here and not in content.md — and the
        price of that is real: it never reaches the bound Google Doc, so an
        editor working there will never see it.

        Height is opt-in via `h`, and only ever a MIN-height: a box grows to at
        least that tall (so a coloured panel can be sized on all sides in the
        editor) but never clips — if the words are taller than `h`, the box
        grows past it. A box with no `h` is auto-height, as before.
